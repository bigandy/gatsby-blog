Inspired by [Derek Sivers' Now](https://sivers.org/now) and his [nownownow repository](https://nownownow.com/):

## Exercise
I have started freestyle swimming lessons once a week at a local school. I am running once or twice a week and go to the gym once or twice a week. In all I do something Mon, Tue, Wed, Friday and on the weekend go walking with the kids once or twice. It is summer so it's great to be outside!

## Career
I am the front-end developer at Venture Harbour and enjoying it thoroughly. It stretches me and breaks me out of my comfort zone on a daily basis. Going forward I want to level up my public persona and this site is one place that I can use to do that. I am starting to manage others, enforce standards and communicate better.

## Writing
Writing is a great way to learn something fully and I want to publish articles on this site as well as the regular weeknotes. I am in the process of moving to a markdown-based blog (either Gatsby or Eleventy as the engine behind the code, I've not yet decided which I prefer).

## Family
Marion's company are currently restructuring and she has to re-apply for her job - or a new job - makes life stressful for us both. Arthur and Emma are both well, Arthur in his final term before going to Primary School (we got the school we wanted!), and Emma is a bag of energy always moving and trying to walk, always getting into cupboards so we have to keep an eye on her constantly.
